#' @section Background:
#'
#' Sharp increases in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, deaths, and costs are
#' stressing the U.S. health care system and caregivers. Without effective
#' interventions, the costs and unpaid care are projected to increase 4-fold by
#' 2050 [1]. The current scientific consensus indicated that the preclinical
#' stage, when patients are still cognitively normal, is the crucial window of
#' opportunity for early interventions before irreversible brain structure
#' changes occur [2, 3]. However, because the preclinical stage is typically
#' asymptomatic, it is important to focus on AD biomarkers, quantify their
#' ordering in time and magnitude of the signal, and estimate their evolution
#' during the preclinical progression of AD.
#'
#' @section Data Sources:
#'
#' There are several major AD data sources exist which allows researchers to
#' conduct their research.
#'
#' The BIOCARD study is a longitudinal, observational study initiated in 1995,
#' and designed to identify biomarkers associated with progression from
#' cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. It
#' enrolled 349 cognitively normal individuals who were primarily middle-aged
#' (mean age=57.1) at enrollment. Most participants by design had a first-degree
#' relative with dementia. Clinical assessments and cognitive testing were
#' completed annually; MRI scans, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood specimens were
#' collected approximately every 2 years. The cohort remains being followed
#' currently with an administrative gap between 2005 and 2009. As of May 31,
#' 2018, 80 participants have cognitive symptom onset. Study characteristics are
#' shown in table 1. This study provides rare and valuable information of
#' longitudinal biomarker measurements over 20 years (median follow up 13.7
#' years) and mostly before subjects have cognitive decline – the crucial
#' preclinical time window for understanding the AD biomarker cascade.
#'
#' The ADNI study is a multicenter observation study launched in 2004, to
#' collect clinical, imaging, genetic and biospecimen biomarkers from cohorts of
#' different clinical states at baseline. It could be characterized as a
#' cross-sectional study with longitudinal follow-up in that participants in
#' diagnostic groups were very different from each other at baseline. The
#' initial phase of ADNI (2004, 5 years) enrolled 200 CN elderly, 400 MCI, and
#' 200 AD. This cohort was followed and augmented in three later phases, ADNI-GO
#' (2009, 2 years), ADNI-2 (2011, 5 years) and ADNI-3 (2016, 5 years), with over
#' 1000 additional participants enrolled in existing cohorts as well as in new
#' cohorts of non-MCI but with Significant Memory Concern (SMC), early MCI, and
#' late MCI. We will only use ADNI subjects that are not demented at baseline in
#' our analysis. This study uses a similar protocol for biomarker measurements
#' as the BIOCARD study. It complements the BIOCARD data on a larger cohort and
#' a wider spread of the AD progression continuum beyond the preclinical phase.
#'
#' The NACC UDS data is a collection of data reflecting the total enrollment
#' since 2005 across 34 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers and includes subjects with a
#' range of cognitive status. The majority of these subjects are followed
#' longitudinally with assessments obtained annually. A standard protocol is
#' used to collect clinical information, neuropsychological test results, CSF
#' markers, and MRI markers when available. This protocol will use a sub-cohort
#' of UDS data that included subjects who had at least one MRI evaluation and
#' had volumetric MRI biomarkers calculated, N= 1317 as of May 2018. This cohort
#' mostly does not have CSF or PET imaging information, but provides information
#' on a large population with intensive cognitive and MRI measures.
#'
#' @section Objectives:
#'
#' In this package, we establish AD data standards and data dictionaries in this
#' package that define the formats and organization structures of the AD data
#' across multiple data sources. R Functions are provided for data analysts to
#' integrate data from multiple data sources and create their analysis dataset.

#' Dictionary of Column Names
#'
#' This dictionary maps the original column names (old_col_name) to the column
#' names of generated analysis dataset. In the raw data, the same variable may
#' have different names. This dictionary could be used to uniform variable
#' names. Also, as some column names in the raw data may be complicated
#' (including space, unit, special symbols, etc.), this dictionary is used to
#' simplify the column names.

#' Parameters
#'
#' List of function parameters in the \code{ADTool} package
#'
#' @name parameters
#' 
#' @param path Directory of the BIOCARD data files. Default value is the working
#'     directory,
#'
#' @param merge_by A character string indicating the source baseline time for
#'     aligning the BIOCARD data when merging multiple files. Options include
#'     "diagnosis", "cognitive", "csf", "hippocampus", "amydata" and
#'     "entorhinal".
#'
#' @param window An integer (unit of days) indicating the maximum acceptable gap
#'     time for merging a biomarker test to base data. Default is 730 days. For
#'     most data, the time windows are calculated from the baseline time (left
#'     window = the midpoint between current and the previous time point; right
#'     window = the midpoint between current and the next time point). If the
#'     time windows are longer than the maximum acceptable length, then force to
#'     select biomarkers within the maximum window length we set. For the first
#'     and last baseline time, since there is no "previous" or "next" time point
#'     available, use the maximum acceptable window length instead.
#'
#' @param window_overlap A logical value indicating the time window setting.
#'     Default "False." If true, all time windows will set from 1/2 "window"
#'     days before the baseline time to the 1/2 "window" days after baseline. In
#'     this case, the time windows may overlap, which means some biomarkers may
#'     be merged into multiple baseline data. If false, the windows will be
#'     calculated from the baseline times. The left window is set to be the
#'     midpoint between the current and the previous time point. The right
#'     window is set to be the midpoint between the current and the next time
#'     point. For the first and last baseline time, since there is no "previous"
#'     or "next" time point available, use the maximum acceptable window length
#'     (set by the parameter "window") instead.
#'
#' @param pattern A string indicating the pattern of all the data files. Default
#'     is "*.xls" (should work for both .xls and .xlsx). This pattern is used to

#'     See \code{\link{dict_src_tables}} for more details.
#'     
#' @param table_code Code of subtables ("Cognitive" as "COG"), which can be mapped
#'     to the source data files and is used for internal data manipulation.

#'     
#' @param str String to search. Default value is NULL. If NULL, this function is
#'     used to check the entire dictionary. If input a string (the variable name
#'     of the analysis dataset), this function is used to check the location and
#'     description of the variable.
#'     
#' @param csv_fname A string indicating the CSV filename to be saved (saved to
#'     the default location). Default is NULL. The saved file is in .scv format.
