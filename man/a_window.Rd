\title{Define the Time Window}
\usage{
a_window(dat, v_date, window, window_overlap, v_id = "subject_id")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{The baseline time dataset.}

\item{v_date}{A string indicating the date name of the baseline time.}

\item{window}{An integer (unit of days) indicating the maximum acceptable gap
time for merging a biomarker test to base data. Default is 730 days. For
most data, the time windows are calculated from the baseline time (left
window = the midpoint between current and the previous time point; right
window = the midpoint between current and the next time point). If the
time windows are longer than the maximum acceptable length, then force to
select biomarkers within the maximum window length we set. For the first
and last baseline time, since there is no "previous" or "next" time point
available, use the maximum acceptable window length instead.}

\item{window_overlap}{A logical value indicating the time window setting.
Default "False." If true, all time windows will set from 1/2 "window"
days before the baseline time to the 1/2 "window" days after baseline. In
this case, the time windows may overlap, which means some biomarkers may
be merged into multiple baseline data. If false, the windows will be
calculated from the baseline times. The left window is set to be the
midpoint between the current and the previous time point. The right
window is set to be the midpoint between the current and the next time
point. For the first and last baseline time, since there is no "previous"
or "next" time point available, use the maximum acceptable window length
(set by the parameter "window") instead.}

\item{v_id}{A string indicating the id name of baseline dateset. Default is
"subject_id" (may varied if using customized column names dictionary).}
}
\value{
A dataset with time window for biomarkers
}
