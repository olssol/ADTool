\arguments{
\item{path}{Directory of the BIOCARD data files. Default value is the working
directory,}

\item{merge_by}{A character string indicating the source baseline time for
aligning the BIOCARD data when merging multiple files. Options include
"diagnosis", "cognitive", "csf", "hippocampus", "amydata" and
"entorhinal".}

\item{window}{An integer (unit of days) indicating the maximum acceptable gap
time for merging a biomarker test to base data. Default is 730 days. For
most data, the time windows are calculated from the baseline time (left
window = the midpoint between current and the previous time point; right
window = the midpoint between current and the next time point). If the
time windows are longer than the maximum acceptable length, then force to
select biomarkers within the maximum window length we set. For the first
and last baseline time, since there is no "previous" or "next" time point
available, use the maximum acceptable window length instead.}

\item{window_overlap}{A logical value indicating the time window setting.
Default "False." If true, all time windows will set from 1/2 "window"
days before the baseline time to the 1/2 "window" days after baseline. In
this case, the time windows may overlap, which means some biomarkers may
be merged into multiple baseline data. If false, the windows will be
calculated from the baseline times. The left window is set to be the
midpoint between the current and the previous time point. The right
window is set to be the midpoint between the current and the next time
point. For the first and last baseline time, since there is no "previous"
or "next" time point available, use the maximum acceptable window length
(set by the parameter "window") instead.}

\item{pattern}{A string indicating the pattern of all the data files. Default
is "*.xls" (should work for both .xls and .xlsx). This pattern is used to
read all table names from the path.}

\item{src_files}{Updated dictionary file for source file features. See
\code{\link{dict_src_files}} for more details.}

\item{src_tables}{Updated dictionary file for source table features. See
\code{\link{dict_src_tables}} for more details.}

\item{vec_name}{A character string indicating the vector needed to be removed special characters.}

\item{lower_case}{A logical value indicating the lower case setting.
Default "False." If true, all characters will to convert to lower cases.}

\item{src_type}{A string indicating the source of data. Options include
"BIOCARD", "NACC" and "ADNI"}

\item{col_name}{A string indicating a column name in the source data file.}

\item{dict_src_tables}{A dictionary file for the parameters. The
default dictionary is appended in the package. Since the parameters in
tables may vary, it could be modified by using a costomized parameter
dictionary. The format can refer to the appended dictionary.
See \code{\link{dict_src_tables}} for more details.}

\item{table_code}{Code of subtables ("Cognitive" as "COG"), which can be mapped
to the source data files and is used for internal data manipulation. 
The options are "COG" (Cognitive), "DIAG" (Diagnosis), "CSF" (FINAL_CSF), "DEMO"
(Demographics), "HIPPO" (Hippocampus), "AMY" (Amygdala), "EC"
(Entorhinal), "GE" (Genetics), "LIST_A" (list of patients not enrolled),
"LIST_B" (list of patients impaired).}

\item{file_names}{List the names of all subtables in the path (all tables
should from the same path).}

\item{dict_src_files}{A path of data file (.csv) of the parameters dictionary. The
default dictionary is appended in the package. Since the parameters in
tables may vary, it could be modified by using a costomized parameter
dictionary. The format can refer to the appended dictionary.
See \code{\link{dict_src_files}} for more details.}

\item{dat}{The baseline time dataset.}

\item{v_date}{A string indicating the date name of the baseline time.}

\item{v_id}{A string indicating the id name of baseline dateset. Default is
"subject_id" (may varied if using customized column names dictionary).}

\item{dat_se}{A dataset that will be merged.}

\item{dat_marker}{A data set including new biomarker that will be merged.}

\item{m_date}{A string indicating the name of measure date in dat_marker.}

\item{rst_dict}{A dataset that waiting to be updated.}

\item{csv_dict}{A dataset with updated information.}

\item{cur_dat}{A dataset indicating current loaded subtable.}

\item{data}{A dataset. Possible choices are "dict_tbl": the dictionary for
the structure of tables, "dict_cil_name": the dictionary maps the
original column names (old_col_name) to the column names of generated
analysis dataset, "dict_data": This dictionary includes all the variables
names in the analysis dataset. This dictionary could be used to check the
location and description of each variable.}

\item{str}{String to search. Default value is NULL. If NULL, this function is
used to check the entire dictionary. If input a string (the variable name
of the analysis dataset), this function is used to check the location and
description of the variable.}

\item{csv_fname}{A string indicating the CSV filename to be saved (saved to
the default location). Default is NULL. The saved file is in .scv format.
If changes of default dictionaries needed, then the costomized dictionary
could be added here. However, the format of the costomized dictionary 
should follow the default one.}

\item{dict}{A string indicating the name of the dictionary. The available
options are: "src_files": the dictionary for table structure, "src_tables": the
dictionary for mapping column names, "ana_data": the dictionary for query, "adni": the dictionary for ADNI
data.}

\item{apoecode}{A string indicating the APOE. The available
options are: 3.4, 4.4, 2.4}

\item{par_apoe}{A list indicating the map for apoecode. Default
value is list(levels = c(3.4, 4.4, 2.4),labels = c(1, 2, NA))).}

\item{ad_ana_data}{The analysis data get from adt_biocard() function.}

\item{...}{}

\item{vars}{A list of strings indicating categorical variables name.}

\item{x}{The analysis data set}

\item{var}{A string indicating the queried variable}

\item{stack_by}{A string indicating the way to group data. Options are "sex" and "diagnosis".}

\item{distn}{A string indicating the interested distribution. Options are "age", "visit", and "yar"}

\item{pat_sub}{A data set contains needed information for ploting}
